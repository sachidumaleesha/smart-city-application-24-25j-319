## Research Project Name - SMART CITY WITH COMPUTER VISION

### Project Description

```
Urbanization has increased population density and infrastructure strain in cities, creating challenges
in managing urban environments efficiently. Traditional methods of urban management struggle
with the complexities of modern cities. Smart cities aim to address these issues by integrating
advanced technologies to improve residents' quality of life, enhance sustainability, and optimize
urban services. Computer vision, a rapidly evolving subset of artificial intelligence, offers
promising solutions to several urban challenges. This research project focuses on leveraging
computer vision technology to enhance various aspects of smart city infrastructure, particularly in
surveillance, traffic management, and waste management.

Ensuring public safety is a critical problem in urban environments. Traditional surveillance systems
require extensive human monitoring, which is prone to errors and inefficiencies. Computer vision
can automate surveillance by providing real-time threat detection and analysis, significantly
improving response times and reducing the reliance on human operators. Advanced algorithms can
identify suspicious activities, unattended objects, and potential security threats with high accuracy,
enhancing overall security in public spaces.

Management in urban areas is often inefficient and labor-intensive, leading to environmental and
health hazards. Computer vision can revolutionize waste management by automating the sorting
and classification of waste materials. High-resolution cameras and advanced image recognition
algorithms can identify different types of waste, such as recyclable, organic, and hazardous
materials, enabling more efficient and accurate sorting. This automation reduces the need for
manual labor, improves recycling rates, and ensures safer disposal of hazardous materials.

The research problem at hand addresses the detection and management of special incidents on
motorways, which pose significant challenges for traffic safety and efficiency. Current systems often
fail to quickly identify and adequately respond to emergencies such as accidents or the presence of
emergency vehicles. By integrating advanced computer vision techniques and AI algorithms within
the infrastructure, the proposed system aims to enhance real-time monitoring and response
capabilities. This setup would allow for the immediate detection of incidents and automatic
notification to relevant authorities and nearby drivers, reducing response times and improving
overall traffic management. This proactive approach to incident management represents a significant
leap forward in creating smarter, safer road environments.

Waste management in urban areas is often inefficient and labor-intensive, leading to environmental
and health hazards. Computer vision can revolutionize waste management by automating the
sorting and classification of waste materials. High-resolution cameras and advanced image
recognition algorithms can identify different types of waste, such as recyclable, organic, and
hazardous materials, enabling more efficient and accurate sorting. This automation reduces the need
for manual labor, improves recycling rates, and ensures safer disposal of hazardous materials.
